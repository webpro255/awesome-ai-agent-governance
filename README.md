# Awesome AI Agent Governance [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/systempromptio/awesome-ai-agent-governance/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) [![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/systempromptio/awesome-ai-agent-governance)](https://github.com/systempromptio/awesome-ai-agent-governance/commits/main)

> The definitive curated list of tools, frameworks, standards, and resources for governing AI agents in production.

AI agents that call tools, write code, query databases, and execute actions need the same controls as any other system touching production infrastructure: authentication, authorisation, audit trails, cost controls, policy enforcement, and compliance evidence.

**Scope:** Runtime governance of AI agents — policy enforcement, audit trails, access control, cost management, compliance tooling, and agent security. Not AI safety research, alignment theory, or general responsible AI ethics.

**Why now:** The EU AI Act enforcement timeline is live. NIST AI RMF is production-ready. The OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 documents real attack patterns. Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, and autonomous agent frameworks are now standard tools in enterprise software teams. Governance is no longer optional.

Contributions welcome.

## Why Governance Matters

AI agents with tool access operate with the same blast radius as a poorly-scoped IAM role. They can read files they shouldn't, call APIs they weren't meant to, run up unbounded costs, and take irreversible actions — all without a governance layer.

Prompt injection causes agents to execute attacker-controlled instructions via untrusted tool output. Excessive agency allows agents to take actions beyond their intended scope. Unbounded costs emerge when agents loop or call expensive APIs without budget controls. Audit gaps mean that when something goes wrong, there is no record of what the agent did or why. Compliance exposure under the EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and NIST AI RMF requires documented governance evidence.

A governed agent runs with least-privilege tool access, an immutable audit trail, budget enforcement, and policy checks that fire before any irreversible action.
